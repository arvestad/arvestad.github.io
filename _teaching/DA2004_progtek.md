This course is my departments introduction to programming. We use Python but
try to focus on the general aspects of programming, that generalize to many
other languages. The practical part is very important with weekly submissions
and a final project.

Other teachers are doing most of the teaching for this course now, but this is
an important course for the department (my humble opinion) and I want to be
engaged in its development.

We have a video series and a compendium in "near-book status" to support the course.
