The idea with the course is to prepare students for working with non-trivial
datasets. This requires programming both practical and analytical tools.

The practical part of the course presents shell commands for working
on the command line, version control systems, an introduction to Java.

The analytical part discusses datastructures, algorithms, and algorithm
analysis, in particular time and space complexity.

There are five labs to practice programming. The project that challenges students
to analyse a large graph from a biological problem. The size of the raw data is inconvenient for simple tools, forcing students to implement alternative solutions.
